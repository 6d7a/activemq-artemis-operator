# ActiveMQ Artemis Operator

This project is a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) [operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html)
to manage the [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/) message broker.

## Status
At the moment the operator version should be considered pre alpha at 0.4.0 and as well the Kube API at v1alphav1
as it is early in its lifecycle and under active development.
